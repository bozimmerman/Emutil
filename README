Emutil is a collection of utilities for dealing with files which are in 
formats most commonly used by Commodore 64 emulators.  

At the moment, the following utilities exist in this project:


D64Search (java)
----------------
A tool for searching the internal filenames and/or file data inside of common 
Emulator image files (.D64, .D71, D80, .D81, .D82).  This tool will report the 
names ofimage files containing matches, and the names of the internal Commodore 
files which were matched.  Supports recursing directories of image files.  It also
supports  

Java version requires Java 1.6 or better.

To execute from the command line (and get further help):
java -jar bin/D64Search.jar 
or
java com.planet_ink.emutil.D64Search

USAGE:
  D64Search <options> <path> <expression>
OPTIONS:
  -R recursive search
  -V verbose
  -M show MD5 sum for each matching file
  -C case sensitive
  -X expr fmt (-Xp=petscii, Xa=ascii, Xh=hex)
  -I search inside files (substring search)
  -D db export of disk info data (-Du<user>,
     -Dp<password>, -Dc<java class>,
     -Ds<service> -Dt<tablename>)
     (Columns: string imagepath,
               string filename, int filenum,
               long size, string md5,
               BLOB filedata,string filetype)

* Expressions include % and ? characters.
* Hex expressions include hex digits, *, and ?.


Emutil.prg (Commodore BASIC/ML)
-------------------------------
A disk image archiver for Commodore 64, 128, VIC-20, Plus/4 and CBM/PET
computers with 16k or more.  It supports all known Commodore disk drives, of all 
capacities.  It also supports all CMD HD and RL Native partitions.

EMUTIL creates and dissolves single and multiple archive images.  The images
may be RLE compressed or uncompressed.  A single uncompressed archive image
of a 1541 disk is equivalent to a .D64 file, so it will handle those just
fine, though it is intended to cover disk drives unsupported by other
programs, such as the CBM 8050/8250 and CMD Native drives.

The program is a collaborative effort by Bo Zimmerman and Andre Fachat.
